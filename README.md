# 📊 Smart Resume Analyzer — *Resume Smarter, Not Harder!*

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to **Smart Resume Analyzer**, a Python-based tool I built to help job seekers like myself improve their resumes and stand out in today’s competitive job market. This project lets you:

- 📄 Analyze your existing resume for key industry skills  
- 📝 Get personalized feedback  
- 📑 Generate a fresh, professional-looking resume and cover letter in seconds  

---

## ✨ Why I Made This

As someone passionate about tech and career growth, I realized many resumes:

- ❌ Miss out on essential keywords recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) look for  
- 📊 Lack measurable resume scores and feedback  
- 🖨️ Are hard to format cleanly and quickly  

So, I built this tool to:

- ✅ Evaluate resumes for critical skills like **Python, Machine Learning, Communication, Problem Solving** and more  
- ✅ Help candidates instantly identify gaps and improve their resume scores  
- ✅ Simplify the resume creation process by auto-generating clean, structured **PDF resumes** and tailored **cover letters**
